    content: "Tacqueria El Vecino, or 'Vecino' for short, is one of the best places to eat for the chips and salsa lover in the Atlanta area (especially if you find yourself nearby). First and foremost, they have a salsa bar. That's right. Salsa BAR. They have approximaltey 6 staple salsas that cover a wide spectrum of flavors, and always have a 'salsa of the day' too. If this wasn't good enough, their chips are pretty solid too. Good firmness for dipping, crisp enough for that satisfying and not tooth-breaking crunch, and you get both corn and flour chips.",

    content: "While it is not necesarily a top destination for chips and salsa, Taco Mac does have the pairing on the menu. The chips are on the breakable and greasy side, and they provide a basic red salsa that is pretty basic.  Nothing memorable, but not a bad choice if the craving hits you and you are locked into eating at a Taco Mac.",

They have a red and a green salsa that are both excellent, but the green is hard to get away from. Worth the visit!",
