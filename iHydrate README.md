# iHydrate
  Welcome to Module One Final Project!

  iHydrate is a CLI application with fully functioning CRUD features.
  iHydrate allows users to create an account and it will save the user information
  in its database. If the user already has an account then they can login.
  If they don't have an account they will be asked to create one.
  After logging in the user will be prompted to pick what they would like to do.
  They have to take a quiz before they're able to interact with the rest of the
  app. After they take a quiz, the app will set a goal for them to reach and
  inform the user what their goal is. After the quiz user will be able to input
  how much water they've had for that day. They also have an option to see
  their progress and how much further they have to go before they reach their
  goal. User also have the option of updating their profile or deleting their
  account entirely.
